"Tutorial on Project homework submission with Git and Github for the course "CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python" " 

I am folowing an online course：“CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python", from EDX (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/course/)

Without Computer Science background, it was not easy for me to figure out how to submit the homework through Git and Github. Another option for homework submission is through a python module called submit50, but it doesn't directly work in Windows. So I am sharing this tutorial here to hopefully help others that are not familiar with Git and Github.
